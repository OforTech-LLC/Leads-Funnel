## CTA Patterns

### Primary CTAs
- "Book Your Consultation"

- **Invisalign**: "Start Your Invisalign Journey"

### Single CTA Focus

- Either "make an appointment" OR "view the smile gallery"
- Not both as competing CTAs

### CTA Design Best Practices
- High contrast colors
- Action-oriented text
- Large, easily clickable
- "Request a Consultation" outperforms generic "Submit"
- Test variations: "Request a Consultation" vs "Book Your Visit Today"

### CTA Placement
- Hero section (primary)
- After smile gallery
- Following testimonials
- After pricing/financing section
- Sticky mobile footer
- Final conversion section

### Treatment-Specific Form

### Credibility Boosters
