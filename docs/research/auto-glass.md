## Objection Handling

### Common Objections & Responses

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| "How much will it cost?"       | "May be $0 with insurance", price ranges    |
| "Will insurance cover it?"     | Insurance checker tool, partner logos       |
| "Will my rates go up?"         | "Glass claims typically don't affect rates" |
| "How long will it take?"       | "Most services completed in 1-2 hours"      |

### Objection-Handling Content Blocks

**Insurance Objection Handler**

```
"Will Filing a Claim Raise My Rates?"
In most cases, no. Filing an insurance claim for windshield
repair or replacement generally won't increase your premium.
Glass claims are typically covered under comprehensive
coverage, which doesn't usually affect your rates.
```

**Cost Objection Handler**

```
"What Will It Cost Me?"
- With Insurance: Often $0 (deductible may be waived)
- Without Insurance: $250-$500 typical range
- We offer payment plans
- We match competitor quotes
```

**Quality Objection Handler**

```
"What Kind of Glass Do You Use?"
- OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) available
- OEE (Original Equipment Equivalent) standard
- All glass meets or exceeds safety standards
- AGRSS certified installation
```
